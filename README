# pics covered
Topics Covered:

1. Basic data structures
2. Functions
3. Decorators
4. Sequences
5. Sets, Dictionaries
6. Object-Oriented Programming

# Project Breakdown

1. in Task 1 we are writing a function (add_numbers) that takes two parameters and returns the sum of the two
2. in Task 2 we are writing a function (is_even) that takes a single parameter and returns true if it is even and false if not
3. in Task 3 we are writing a function (reverse_string) that takes a string (text) as input and returns the reversed version of that string.
4. in Task 4 we are writing a function (count_vowels) that takes a string (text) as input and returns the count of vowels 
5. in Task 5 we are writing a function (calculate_factorial ) that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number
6. in Task 6 we are writing a function (apply_decorator ) that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named (decorator_func). The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.
7. in task 7 we are writinga a function (sort_by_age) that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order
8. in Task 8 we are writing a function (merge_dicts) that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary
9. in Task 9 we are writing a function (display_info) that prints out the car's information

# Getteing started
1. clone the repository to your console
2. open the file
3. un each code to check if it works
